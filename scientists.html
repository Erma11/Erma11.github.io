        <p><em><strong>- An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes
        that can be made in a very narrow field.</strong></em></p> 
    <p>Bohr investigated the structure of quantum fluctuations in the very early
    universe.  In 1922, he received the Nobel Prize for his work in
    atomic structure and radiation.  He developed his own atomic
    model that expanded the field of quantum theory.  His work has
    influenced our understanding of physical reality.</p>

    <P><em><strong>- Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.
      The important thing is not to stop questioning.</strong></em></P>
      <p>Einstein developed the Theory of Relativity.  He was awarded
      the Nobel Prize in 1921 for services to theoretical physics and
      for the discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.  He challenged
      Newtonian physics through his quantum theory.  In addition,
      he transformed the image of the Scientist in the 20th Century.</p>

    <p><em><strong>- Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns,
    so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization
    of the entire tapestry.</strong></em></p>
    <p>Feynman reintroduced the theory of the interaction between
    light and matter (quantum electrodynamics) and changed
    the way science understands the nature of waves and
    particles.  In additon, he pioneered the field of quantum computing and introduced
    the concept of nanotechnology.</p>

    <p><em><strong>- We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the
    very early universe.</strong></em></p>
    <p>Hawking determined that black holes emit radiation.  This is
    called 'Hawking Radiation'.  He predicted that black holes
    were created follwing the Big Bang and proposed that the
    universe has no boundaries.  He reshaped the way the world thinks about black holes
    and the universe.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.famousscientists.org/isaac-newton//">Isaac Newton</h3></a>
    <p><em><strong>- If I have seen the future, it is by standing upon
    the shoulders of giants.</strong></em></p>
    <p>Newton formulated the theory of gravitation and the laws of motion.
    This law became the basis for physics.  In the field of the
    study of light (optics) he proved his theory that white light
    is composed of a mixture of other colors of light.  When split
    apart by a prism, they form a band of colors called a spectrum.
    This was revolutionary.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/schrodinger-facts.html/">Erwin Schrodinger</h3></a>
    <p><em><strong>- Quantum physics thus reveals the basic oneness of
    the universe.</strong></em></p>
    <p>Schrodinger won the Nobel Prize in 1933 for the Schrodinger Equation.
    This calculated the movements of electrons in terms of wave
    mechanics as opposed to particle leaps.  He is well known for the
    thought experiment 'Schrodinger's Cat'.  This is a state called 
    'quantum superposition' in which an event may, or may not,
    occur.</p>
